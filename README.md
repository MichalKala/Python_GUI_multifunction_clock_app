# Python Multifunction clock



Project I have done as part of my Python self study - multifunction GUI application, with following tabs:
1. Current time and date
    - Displays current time (ticking each second) and current date
    
2. Alarm clock
    - Displays current time and asks you to input number of hours and minutes. 
    - When user presses "Set" the clock will start ticking down from chosen time to zero
    - When last second is passed, a youtube video opens in browser with a song to wake up user
    
3. Countdown timer
    - Ask user to set amount of seconds, then clock start ticking down and turn red when last second is passed
    
4. Stopwatch
    - Self explanatory - user can use buttons START, STOP and RESET
    
5. About the app
    - Tab with text explaining the project and button with url link to my github
